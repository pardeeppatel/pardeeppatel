# Hello, folks! 👋

I’m **Pardeep Patel**. I can split my Journey into two halves

## First Half

I did my graduation in **Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science** from College of Science and Engineering, Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh 
which is affiliated to Uttar Pradesh Technical University, Lucknow, INDIA and Post Graduation in **Master of Technology (M.Tech) in Computer Science** 
from Shaheed Udham Singh College of Engineering & Technology, Tangori, Punjab which is affiliated to Punjab Technical University, Jalandhar, INDIA. 
So it is the obvious thing I love and have interest in to write Code and **full-time developer**. 
Apart from this I love to travel a lot, that makes me a **part-time traveler** too.

## Second Half

I left my Job in 2016 and became a Blogger as well as Story Writer too. 
Developed few websites like 
1. [Pardeep Patel](https://pardeeppatel.com/),

4. [Study Warehouse](https://studywarehouse.com/),
5. [Plan For Germany](https://planforgermany.com/),
